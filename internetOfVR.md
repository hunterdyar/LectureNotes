# The Internet of VR

 The Metaverse, connecting worlds, inspiring creativity, and using a web browser to deliver VR content.

---
# The Current State of VR
- Video Games as model for content Delivery
- Multiplayer is limited to small experiences
- Fiddly avatars, fiddly voice chat, etc
- Real-world usability is improving slowly
---
## Video Games Model for Content Delivery
- Software Downloaded
  - offline
  - always available once downloaded
- Updates pushed
  - users eventually updated
  - Multiplayer systems need version matching
  - Some users will never get updates
---
## Videogame Storefronts
- Multiple Stores
- Different stores with overlapping and exclusive titles for overlapping and exclusive hardware
- Account(s) requires
- Hard to give things away for free
- Cost to host on store...
---
Videogame Storefronts
### Cost to get content on a store
- Literal cost
- Deal with store owners, their terms/conditions/whims/permissions
- Time to upload, manage, and replace
- You still have to do almost all of the work
- Marketing mostly not included
- “Gatekeepers”
- Storefront decides what is "acceptable"
---
Alternative Models for Content Delivery
# Arcades
- Real world locations that have hardware and software titles managed (hey, the lab!) 
- VR Arcades exist!

---
Alternative Models for Content Delivery
# Radio
- Stream content from hub to many headsets
- Exclusivity through timing
- Streaming Services with "free for a week" events showing viability
- Community
- Technical challenges
---
Alternative Models for Content Delivery
# Disks/Cartridges
- Treat software into hardware purchases, deliver through existing environments, like stores.
- Owning a cartridge is easy to let a friend borrow, sell used, etc
---
Alternative Models for Content Delivery
# Websites
- Anyone can just … go to an experience with a URL.
- Challenging to get paid, get exposure.
- Blogs, Hubs (miniclip.com), and communities introduced to support these challenges. More democratic/meritocratic, but still gatekeepers. 

---
# The possibilities
Websites as VR content delivery system 

---
Possibilities
# The Metaverse
Collective Virtual Shared Space
(probably not like we are imagining)
Still: Wikipedia for 3D environments? Scans? Models? Virtual Places?

---
Possibilities
# Environments -> URLS
Navigation provides paradigms for navigation

---
Possibilities
# Synchronous Social Environments
- Chat rooms become rooms
- Multiple users browse the same environments together?

---
Possibilities
# Virtual Gathering

Active Community: Classrooms, Events, Concerts
Passive Community: Streaming, Hangout spots

*see: tcgs chatroom*

---
Possibilities
# The Geocities City
Can the tools for delivery become democratized like the web has: HTML, CSS, RSS feeds

*Anyone can start a podcast, it’s just an RSS feed. Companies can't own the ecosystem, despite attempts*

Can we have that for virtual environments?

---
Possibilities
# Open Creative Expression
Creativity, ideas, and expression are not services, goods, and paid things.

- Accessible tools to create have a disproportionate control over what gets created.
- Making good things is *hard.*
- Why shouldn't creators get paid tho

# What Else?

# Challenges to the Internet of VR

---
Challenges
# Hardware Compatability

Most devices have web browsers.
This is kind of incredible.

---
Challenges
# Environment Compatability

Seated vs room scale.
Sound vs. no sound
Microphone?

---
Challenges
# Accessibility
Comfort
Reliability
Predictability

---
Challenges
# Privacy & Security

What are we uploading to what web servers.
*Luckily we have the internet's history to learn from.*

---
Challenges
## Gatekeepers

- Protection from unwanted content
  - (we want some gatekeepers?)
  - *NSFW aside, Geocities was full of trolling, conspiracy theories, misinformation, cyber bullying, and more.*

# The Internet of VR
# Already Exists

---
# WebXR & OpenXR
(WebXR = WebVR)
(OpenXR != OpenVR)

---
WebXR and OpenXR allow websites to be rendered by VR Hardware.

---
# WebXR is
Set of Standards, Specifications, Tools, & Concepts
https://immersive-web.github.io/

Currently supported on most major browsers

---
# WebXR is not
- Does not aim to exhaustively suport features/hardware
- Does not declare how XR devices work
  - compare this to iOS development
- Is not trying to build a metaverse

*This is directly taken from their documentation*

---
# Projects

---
Tools
# A-Frame
Toolkit for development
Uses standard HTML syntax
Built in inspector to learn how any a-frame application is built
htt://aframe.io

---
# Other Tools
- PrimroseVR
- Babylon.JS
- React 360
- Three.js

---
# What about development in... Unity?

---
# Unity WebXR Exporter
Yes
Seriously?
Yes
Thanks, Mozilla!
